# 🧠 Transformer Visualizer with Manim

A comprehensive visualization of the Transformer architecture, built using [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), the mathematical animation engine. This project animates key components of the Transformer model to help you intuitively understand how they work.

## 📽️ What’s Included?

This visualizer breaks down and animates the following key concepts in the Transformer architecture:

- 🔤 **Tokenization**  
  Demonstrates how raw text is converted into tokens.

- 🔢 **Embeddings**  
  Animates vector representations of tokens.

- 🧭 **Positional Encoding**  
  Visualizes the sine/cosine positional encodings overlaid on token embeddings.

- 🔍 **Attention Mechanism**  
  Intuitive animation of the Scaled Dot-Product Attention, including queries, keys, values, and attention weights.

- 🏗️ **Encoder Stack**  
  Layer-by-layer visualization of the encoder modules.

- 🧱 **Decoder Stack**  
  Includes masked attention and cross-attention mechanisms.

- 🔄 **Full Transformer Architecture**  
  Integration of all components showing the complete forward pass from input tokens to output.
